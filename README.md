I am Richard Thomas, a Senior Lecturer in the [School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://eecs.uq.edu.au/ "School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science") at the [University of Queensland](https://uq.edu.au/ "The University of Queensland").
I teach our [Software Architecture](https://csse6400.uqcloud.net/ "CSSE6400 Software Architecture") course and run a number of [short-term international study tours](https://www.eait.uq.edu.au/global-experiences/eait-study-tours "EAIT Study Tours") for students.
